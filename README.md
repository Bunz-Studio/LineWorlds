# LineWorlds
 An open-source Dancing Line Fanmade editor!
 ## Info
 This project was only made as my hobby. Pretty much a passion project. 
 
 If you want to only use the editor, [you can download the launcher instead](https://redark-technology.itch.io/line-worlds)
 and you can also [watch this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw-Q1et8zEs) if you're confused on how to set it up
 
 I wasn't paid or anything so don't request me expensive features here...
 
 And also... please consider donating at [my Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/bunzhizendi) so I can keep continue making useful stuff for you guys :D
 
 Thank you for visiting this GitHub page <3
